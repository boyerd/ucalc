=====

A simple project to build a CPU and all of the associated software ecosystem.  Parts of the project are:

Assembler - convert human readable assembly instructions into custom machine code.

Softcpu - process machine code and produce outputs in order to verify software behavior quickly.

hdl - HDL specification for the custom CPU.

Tclcpu - an instruction-accurate softcpu to utilize as a testbench to verify the behavior of the hardware.

Currently, the only the assembler is under progress and the rest exist only as sketches.
